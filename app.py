#API - Application Programming Interface.

#The GET Method - GET is used to request data from a specified resource. When you access a websiteâ€™s page, your browser makes a get request to your API and your API is returning the front-end that is displayed in the browser.
# All the APIs that you create in Flask, by default, use GET Request. If you start your hello_world server and go to localhost:5000, you can see in your terminal that the browser made a GET request on the server/API.
# The POST Method - POST is used to send data to the server to create/update a resource.
# A user wants to sign up from the signup page. A user wants to change their password
# The PUT Method - PUT is used to send data to a server to create / update a resource.
# The basic difference between PUT and POST is that a POST request is when you can create multiple copies of the same resource. A PUT request, on the other hand means that you want to create only one copy of the resource, i.e. Signing Up a unique user.
# The DELETE Method - DELETE is used to delete a resource.
